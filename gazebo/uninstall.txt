If you're running Ubuntu, and installed ROS with apt-get, the first step would be

sudo apt-get remove ros-*

If you've created a workspace, you'll have to also remove that... and if you added the setup scripts to your .bashrc, you'd have to remove them too.

If you've installed from source then it will be more complicated.

Uninstalling Source-based Install

If you need to uninstall Gazebo or switch back to a debian-based install of Gazebo when you currently have installed Gazebo from source, navigate to your source code directory's build folders and run make uninstall:

cd ~/gazebo/build
sudo make uninstall
cd ~/sdformat/build
sudo make uninstall
